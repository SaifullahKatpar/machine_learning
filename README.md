# Machine Learning Repository

This repository contains multiple machine learning projects organized for clarity and reusability. Each project is encapsulated within its directory, making it easy to navigate and understand the codebase.

## Introduction

Welcome to our Machine Learning Repository! This repository is designed to house various machine learning projects, each focusing on different tasks, datasets, or experiments. The goal is to provide a clear and organized structure for managing and sharing machine learning code.

## Repository Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- `common/`: Shared code and utilities that can be reused across different projects.
- `project1/`, `project2/`, ...: Directories for individual machine learning projects, each with its own data, notebooks, scripts, and documentation.
- `experiments/` (optional): A directory for storing shared experiment logs, results, and checkpoints.
- `environment.yml` (or `requirements.txt`): Files specifying dependencies for the entire repository.
- `.gitignore`: A Git ignore file to exclude unnecessary files and directories from version control.

## Getting Started

To get started with a specific project, navigate to its respective directory (e.g., `project1/`) and refer to its README for project-specific instructions, dependencies, and usage guidelines.

If you wish to run code from the shared `common/` directory, make sure to install the repository-wide dependencies using:

```bash
# If using conda environment.yml
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate ml-repo

# If using pip requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements.txt
